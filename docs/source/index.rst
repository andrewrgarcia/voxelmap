Ever wanted to make simple 3-D models from numpy arrays? Now you can do that with voxelmap ! **Voxelmap** is a Python library for 
making voxel and three-dimensional models from NumPy arrays. It was initially made to streamline 3-D voxel modeling by assigning each
integer in an array to a voxel. Now, methods are being developed for mesh representations, voxel-to-mesh transformation and vice-versa.
